    <h3 style="color: purple;">Initially JavaScript was developed to "make Web pages alive."In this language the programs are called scripts. They can be written right in the HTML of a web page, and run as page loads automatically. Scripts are given as plain text, and executed. We don't need to run special arrangements or compilations. JavaScript is very different from another language named Java in this aspect.</h3>
